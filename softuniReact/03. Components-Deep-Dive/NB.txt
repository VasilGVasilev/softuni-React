About Keys and Lists
    React vDOM is optimises the DOM very efficiently and if
    we attach <li>s to a <ul> using a for loop, when vDOM transfer
    info to DOM, it will lose this capability of specific update,
    no entire re-render.
    That is why we use keys that React uses to map elements/nodes onto
    the vDOM and if necessary update just the specific <li> via its
    specific key.

    
    React understands arrays, even if we did not have <li>s, React will understand 
    the array made via .map() and render it as a list

    each key is has to be unique but just in comparison to other siblings in list
