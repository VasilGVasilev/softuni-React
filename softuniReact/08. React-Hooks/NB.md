Hooks since v16.8

Hooks share functionality, they actually add functionality to otherwise static presentational functional components, hooks also make the functional components go against their nature of pure functionality

State hook lets you persist information stored even during re-render, unlike, a simple variable storing, which will be lost at the moment browser re-renders content; this is accomplished via closures
