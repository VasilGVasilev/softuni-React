React component
    is a function that returns a React element, only one element, 
    it may be a wrapper element that has others inside, but still only one

ident using spaces 
    -> validate with Alt + Shift + fancy

stylisation
    each component has a specific css in a dir that relates to that component

architecture 
    not a good idea to have a middelware with components that with set in App.js


fragments
    <Fragment>, often used via <>...</> syntax, lets you group elements without a wrapper node
    unlike, a <div></div> that will show on the DOM as an element
        <>
        <OneChild />
        <AnotherChild />
        </>
