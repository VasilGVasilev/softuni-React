Class TaskList extends Component {
    constructor(props) {
        super(props)
    }

    render() {
        return (

        )
    }
}

    Constructor runs before anything else in the class-based code in react.js to the life-cycle of the component. Constructor code runs once, and only once, for the entire life-cycle of this component in react.
    Constructor is an initialization field for among many - state

    super() calls contructor() which initializes the component, NB - dont pollute with external data (fetch) the constructor of a react class component

    Why do we call super? Can we not call it? If we have to call it, what happens if we donâ€™t pass props? Are there any other arguments? Letâ€™s find out.

    In JavaScript, super refers to the parent class constructor. (In our example, it points to the React.Component implementation.)

    Importantly, you canâ€™t use 'this' in a constructor until after youâ€™ve called the parent constructor. JavaScript wonâ€™t let you:

        class Checkbox extends React.Component {
            constructor(props) {
                // ðŸ”´ Canâ€™t use `this` yet
                super(props);
                // âœ… Now itâ€™s okay though
                this.state = { isOn: true };
            }
        }
    Summary: we use super() in props to be able to use 'this' which may inherit from a parent component, we may pass or we may not pass props in super(props) JS will make it available anyways for methods outside contructor - thus better define it so that 'this' is available in constructor
