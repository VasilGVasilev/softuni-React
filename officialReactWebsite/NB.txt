production-ready JSX setup
    Essentially, adding JSX is a lot like adding a CSS preprocessor. 
    The only requirement is to have Node.js installed on your computer.
    npm init -y
    npm install babel-cli@6 babel-preset-react-app@3

Create a folder called src and run this terminal command:
    npx babel --watch src --out-dir . --presets react-app/prod
    Don’t wait for it to finish — this command starts an automated watcher for JSX.
